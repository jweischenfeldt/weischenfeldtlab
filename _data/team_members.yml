  education1: <b>Profile:</b> Joachim did his PhD at BRIC with Prof Porse followed by postdoctoral fellowship in the lab of <a href="https://www.embl.org/groups/korbel/">Jan Korbel</a> at EMBL, Heidelberg. <p>The interest of the lab spans different aspects of cancer genomics. A focus area is larger structural variants in cancer, their emergence and functional consequences and how the evolve during tumour evolution</p>
  education2: <b>About/Fun fact:</b> Trends come and go, but one thing you can be sure of is when Joachim invites his group to the yearly retreat he’ll always remember to include his infamous science karaoke in the program (also known as Joachim’s thing). The concept is simple, after all presentations, Joachim prepares an extra slideshow with randomly picked slides from each presentation. Then for each slide a randomly picked group member needs to explain what is going on, on the slide. You better listen carefully to your colleagues' presentations or you better come up with something good. Do not fear to run out of cola, he always brings his own stack of cans at work. So you may enjoy refreshment during Liverpool or Danish national team football games in his cinema size screen at his office.

Proud of his Spanish heritage, he always brings Ambrosías Tirma, exquisite wafers from Gran Canaria, for his colleagues and he never has lunch before 3pm.

  education2: <b>About/Fun fact:</b> Josephine likes to drink tea. She actually likes it so much that she once even had a tea Christmas calendar, with different tea flavors for each day. Josephine is also a very social person and besides singing, dancing and clubbing at fancy places in Copenhagen, she also organized a knitting club together with Migle during the pandemic. Speaking of dancing, at one of the BRIC parties, she danced so hard, trying to keep up with German’s latino moves, that she accidently fell on the dancefloor. Josephine bravely wanted to continue doing her thing, but Coline and colleagues convinced her that it was probably better to go to the hospital to get some stitches instead. Lastly, it is also worth mentioning that Josephine is the proud winner of a lifetime supply of cereals.

  education2: <b>About/Fun fact:</b> Migle is quite a popular name in her home country not as a person's name but as a very delicious candy bar. If she could keep any animal as a pet she would choose a cat if she was not allergic to it. Not many people know this but she can’t stand any sounds (Keyboard, chewing) unless it’s music. She likes to listen to the same song over and over again while biking as slowly as she can. The weather is never warm enough for her, that's why she prefers drinking lukewarm water.
